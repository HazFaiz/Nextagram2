react router > show different components based on what you wanna view without refreshing page. in react,page is all loaded in first place but components are shown conditionally



put loading state in homepage

<Route exact path ="/"
<Homepage users={users} />
</Route>
<Route exact path ="/about"
<Aboutpage/>
</Route>


navbar links using link from reactrouter, not a tag

import {Link} form reactrouterdom

<NavItem>
<Link to="/">Home>Link>
</NavItem> << wont take reactstrap style

<NavLink tag={Link} to="/"> Home</NavLink> << will keep styling if use tag=

Normal anchor tags will actually refresh the page, not the behavior we want.we want to switch components without refreshing page. whole selling point of react


<Route path="/user/:id">
<UserProfile>
</Route>

Use value that gets passed into the :id


import {useParams} from reactrouterdom

const useParams = useParams()


change CardTitle to Link
<Link to={`/user/${user.id}`}

once have userid can makeapi call using the id and display just that users profile
